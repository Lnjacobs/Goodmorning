# Goodmorning

# This is a personal project to help create productive mornings in a working enviorment. The aim is to create an alarm to go off at the start of each working morning.
# Then the user is shown the weather, date, running to do list, unopened emails, and the next 10 calender events.

# The todo list has the ability to have items added or removed. Additionally it can be displayed outside of the initial morning greeting.

# The weather is created using 'Open Weather', uaing a free account I created. It will not worked if called more than 100 times/minute
# Website: https://openweathermap.org/api

# Unopened emails are presented- and opened in the process. For this code to work a passcode and username must be used. For the sake of trial a proxy account has been created to recieve spam mail and the emails can be checked. 
# Process to set up account/totorial followed: https://www.techgeekbuzz.com/how-to-read-emails-in-python/

# The calender API will connect to the same faux email account above, with some repeating events contained. An additional credientials folder is included that is needed to access the project. 
# Tutorial used: https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python

# For the future- included deadlines

# NOTE: No serveres are currently set up to run this program!
